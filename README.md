# Leaflet

Leaflet is a community-first library for lending and borrowing books. The frontend is a Vite-powered React SPA that talks to Supabase for authentication, storage, realtime updates, and Postgres access. This repository contains everything you need to run Leaflet locally, contribute new features, and maintain the Supabase schema metadata that accompanies the app.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** (ESM support & fetch in Node)
- **npm** (ships with Node)
- **Supabase project** with Postgres, Realtime, Storage enabled

### Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/project-nexus.git
cd project-nexus
npm install
```

> ⚠️ You may see a warning from Husky if Git hooks cannot be installed (e.g., in read-only environments). This does not impact local development.

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root. At minimum you need client-side Supabase credentials:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://<project-ref>.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<anon-key>
```

If you plan to export Supabase schema metadata (see [Supabase & Schema Dumps](#supabase--schema-dumps)), also populate the database connection variables listed in `.env.sample`.

### Run Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser. Supabase Auth requires exact URL matches for redirect URIs, so ensure `http://localhost:5173` is whitelisted in your Supabase project settings.

---

## Supabase & Schema Dumps

Leaflet tracks Supabase metadata (tables, columns, RLS policies, etc.) in JSON files under `supabase_schema/`. To refresh them after changing the database:

1. Ensure you have database credentials in `.env` (`SUPABASE_DB_URL` _or_ host/user/password) and `SUPABASE_SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL`.
2. Use the pooler connection string if you are on an IPv4-only network (e.g., `aws-0-<region>.pooler.supabase.com`).
3. Run manually whenever you need fresh metadata:
   ```bash
   npm run getSchema
   ```
4. Commit the updated JSON files alongside the database migration (`supabase_schema/update.sql`).

> Tip: To apply SQL changes and refresh metadata in one step, run `npm run updateDB`. The script will apply `supabase_schema/update.sql`, invoke `npm run getSchema`, and then clear `update.sql`.

The script reads `supabase_schema/getSchemaDump.sql` which is organised into nine sections (tables, columns, constraints, indexes, triggers, views, functions, sequences, RLS policies). Each section is written atomically to a matching JSON file.

## Role-Based Administration

Leaflet recognises three roles. Policies are enforced by Supabase RLS functions defined in `supabase_schema/update.sql`.

| Role          | Description & Powers                                                                                                                           |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `user`        | Default. Full end-user functionality but no moderation controls.                                                                               |
| `admin`       | Can access `/admin` to moderate books, requests, and active loans.                                                                             |
| `super_admin` | Seeded account determined by the `SUPABASE_SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL` environment variable. Can promote/demote roles, has unrestricted access via RLS. |

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for day-to-day responsibilities and how to manage roles through the Admin Dashboard.

## Architecture Notes

1. **Services (data access)**

   - Located under `src/services/**` and the sole authorised place to use Supabase JS client.
   - Each file targets a domain (`bookService`, `adminService`, etc.).
   - `src/services/index.js` re-exports a curated surface for UI consumption.

2. **Contexts (state orchestration)**

   - `AuthContext` wraps Supabase session handling.
   - `BookContext` coordinates book lists, saved state, realtime listeners.
   - `UserContext` aggregates profile data, requests, and loans; exposes `role`, `isAdmin`, `isSuperAdmin`.

3. **Hooks & Utilities**

   - Hooks convert repeated UI logic into reusable functions (`useImageDrop`, `useRole`, `useDashboardData`).
   - Utilities are pure, testable helpers (validation, login/signup flows, logging).

4. **Admin Dashboard Flow**
   - `AdminRoute` ensures an authenticated admin (or super admin) can access `/admin` without forcing profile completion.
   - `AdminDashboard` relies on `adminService.js` to list users (for super admin) and moderate books/requests/loans.
   - RLS policies in `supabase_schema/update.sql` mirror the checks enforced in the client.

---

## Development Guidelines

- **Boundary discipline**: UI never touches Supabase directly. Add new calls to `src/services/**` and export via `index.js`.
- **Profile-guarded routes**: `PrivateRoute` defaults to requiring a completed profile but can be relaxed via `requireProfile={false}` (used for `/admin`).
- **Role checks**: Use `useRole()` or `useUser()` so logic stays consistent with context state.
- **Supabase changes**: Update `supabase_schema/update.sql`, then regenerate JSON via `npm run getSchema`, and document in commit/PR.
- **Error handling**: Services call `logError` with context; UI shows toast or inline feedback.

---

## Testing & Quality

- **Unit / Integration**: `npm run test` (Vitest) covers hooks, contexts, and utilities.
- **Linting**: `npm run lint` (ESLint) with React recommended rules.
- **Pre-commit**: Husky + lint-staged run `eslint --fix` + `prettier` on staged files when hooks are enabled.

---

## Deployment Tips

- **Environment variables**: Supply the same `.env` values to your hosting provider (e.g., Vercel). Never expose service-role keys.
- **Supabase policies**: Ensure `supabase_schema/update.sql` has been executed on your Supabase instance. Run schema exports before each release to catch drift.
- **IPv4 vs IPv6**: Supabase direct connection hosts are IPv6-only. Use the transaction or session pooler host when connecting from IPv4 environments (local dev, CI).
